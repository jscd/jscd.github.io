Hi!

I'll probably delete this post once I start saying things here that are
actually substantial, but I've got my new blog up and running! 

I've moved from using [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev), a perfectly adequate
and wonderful platform, to this kinda haphazardly tossed together mess of my
own shitty HTML/CSS and a set of Jinja templates and Markdown parsers.

Why did I do this? I don't know!


...


Anyway, I hope I actually use this one.
