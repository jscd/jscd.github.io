I'm starting.

That's right, I'm finally, *finally* doing it. I'm starting a blog. *My* blog. And this first post is going to tell you (and myself, I suppose) why I'm doing it.

## Why I'm doing it.

1. It reminds me to think.

Now don't get me wrong, I think about a lot of things. I think about what food I'm going to eat and what clothes I'm going to wear and what video game I'd like to play and which Dark Souls game is the best, all the important stuff.

But what I've noticed, and I suppose this gets a bit into your own philosophies on free will<sup>1</sup>, is that I don't really *choose* a lot about what I'm thinking about, if that makes sense. On many days, I just think about whatever comes to mind.

I guess the phenomenon I'm trying to describe is **auto-pilot**: when you aren't very consciously thinking about what you are thinking about. I know this sort of thing varies person-to-person, but for me, I enter auto-pilot pretty frequently. It helps when I want to be zoning into a task, but if I need to multitask (or go to classes with a wonky schedule, like GT often forces me into), it becomes a bit of a struggle to handle that in-between time.

I've had some small successes in getting out of autopilot. I took [CGP Grey's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck) on dividing up your spaces, which definitely eased the transitions between schoolwork and money-work and not-work, and that seemed to help my workflow.

My next big step, or at least the next step I'm trying to take, is to think more about what I have to say. And that's where this comes in. 

I know I'm not going to be good at it initially (or maybe at all, we'll see), but I'd like to at least try to get myself out there, say stuff that's interesting to hear, and describe my experiences. Like I said, we'll see.

Also I like computer science, wow how'd I forget that one.
